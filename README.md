The method getCalendar() should return all course items,
office hour items and appointment items. Each item (i.e. formatted TimeBlock)
should be listed under a heading with the day of the week. Within a particular
day, the items should be listed in sorted order by time (Hint: Sorting is not
necessary -- use a loop that goes from 5 to 2400 by 5's.).

# The toString() method

---

The toString method should return a String formatted as in
the input file. Notice that TimeBlock.toString() will not include the location
or comment properties. Most classes will have each property on a new line,
TimeBlock properties will be separated by a comma.

# Handling ArrayLists

---

Each ArrayList should have five associated methods to
perform: getNum, add, get, set and remove. So if you have an ArrayList named
widgets that stored items of type Widget, then the associated UML would be:

# Input File

---

The input file will be read by
the user using any file reader and input streams (BufferedReader or Scanner) to
your main() method using command-line arguments. The format for the input file
is shown below:
